This is a re-implementation of some classic PDP-11 games
with the curses API. So far, only Super-Pacman (sp21) is
implemented, as it was the most popular game at the time.
 
Any contributions to the project are always welcome.

The goal of sp21 is to collect the all dots in the maze and
avoid ghosts. The game is controlled by the arrow keys.
